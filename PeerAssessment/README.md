Getting_and_Cleaning_Data
=========================

Project for JHU Getting and Cleaning Data courses

## run_analysis.R script finish the following missions:
* step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
* step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How you should reproduce this research
* step 1: Unzip this file https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and them remove all the .txt files unziped into a new folder named 'dataset'.
* step 2: In the dataset folder,create a new r script named 'run_analysis.R".
* step 3: Run the run_analysis.R in Rstudio. You will then find two new .txt files generated by the code, they are:
  -       Sum_data.txt: data set with discriptive variable names
  -       means_of_act_sub.txt: which store the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* step 4: Because both the .txt files are too big, I recommend you to open these two files with SublimeText or NotePad. 
* Thanks for visiting!
